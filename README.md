# Polygon Area Calculator

## Project Overview
The Polygon Area Calculator is a Python-based application that allows users to calculate various properties of geometric shapes, specifically rectangles and squares. Users can interact with the program by providing the dimensions of the shapes, such as width, height, or side length, and choose from several calculations, including area, perimeter, diagonal length, and even the ability to visualize the shape in a simple ASCII picture.

## Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for implementing the polygon area calculator logic.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The program employs OOP principles to create classes (Rectangle, Square) that model the geometric shapes and their properties.
String Manipulation: Utilized for formatting and outputting text-based visualizations of the shapes.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: For calculations related to the area, perimeter, diagonal, and fitting smaller shapes inside larger ones.
